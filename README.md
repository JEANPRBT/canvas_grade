# Canvas API Grade Calculator
> Python application which calculates my grade for the Ethical Hacking course. The app authenticates using my access 
> token, connects to Canvas API and retrieves requested hints as well as correct submitted assignments in order to 
> estimate my course grade.

## How to use it ?
+ Go into the working directory
+ Set up a Python virtual environment - `python3 -m venv env`
+ Activate the virtual environment - `source env/bin/activate`
+ Install the requested packages - `pip3 install requirements.txt`
+ Launch the program - `python3 main.py`
 
## Logging features
This app supports logging, and writes all HTTP requests generated by the program and their corresponding responses to
file `requests.log`, in the working directory.

## Notes

This app uses the wonderful Python wrapper for Canvas API, `canvasapi`.
It first retrieves all my correct submitted assignments. To check if my submissions are correct, I compare the content 
to the actual correct flag, which I know since I finished the course. Then, I retrieve the hints I requested using
groups to decrease my grade accordingly.

I could have extended the program to other users by directly using the `grade` of each assigment, but then there would 
not be that much logic since I would not need to retrieve the requested hints. Since flags are different for everyone, 
this solution only works for my API key, which is provided. :)
